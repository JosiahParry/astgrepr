# astgrepr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`astgrepr` provides R bindings to the
[ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) Rust crate. `ast-grep` is a tool
to parse the abstract syntax tree (AST) of some code and to perform
search and rewrite of code. This is extremely useful to build linters,
stylers, and perform a lot of code analysis.

Since `astgrepr` can be used as a low-level foundation for other tools
(such as linters), it doesnâ€™t rely on any R dependencies (but has Rust
dependencies brought in by `ast-grep`).

``` r

library(astgrepr)

src <- "library(tidyverse)
    x <- rnorm(100, mean = 2)
    any(duplicated(y))
    plot(x)
    any(duplicated(x))"

node <- src |> 
  tree_new() |> 
  tree_root()

# get everything inside rnorm()
node |> 
  node_find(pattern = "rnorm($$$A)") |> 
  node_get_multiple_matches("A") |> 
  node_text_all()
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "100"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] ","
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [1] "mean = 2"
```

``` r

# find occurrences of any(duplicated())
node |> 
  node_find_all(pattern = "any(duplicated($A))") |> 
  node_text_all()
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "any(duplicated(y))"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] "any(duplicated(x))"
```
